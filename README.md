## Project notes:
- This project has been tested and works on IE11, using a virtual machine
- The project has been built for production, these files can be found within the /dist folder

## Future improvements:
- Add more text to describe dropdown list data i.e. Cigarettes: 1, Air quality: 268 PM2.5. This text should be translated when the selected language is Hindi
- Add a map that shows the user where the selected city is. This can be built with D3.js and Datamaps https://datamaps.github.io/
- Add styling for the language buttons as well as the select city dropdown
- Include more responsive styling so the hero image title doesn't drop below the hero image on smaller screens
- Write more tests that test the select city dropdown list functionality
- Change the favicon
